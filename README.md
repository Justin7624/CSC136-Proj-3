# CSC136-Proj-3
**Overview:**

This repository contains an implementation of a dynamic array data structure in C++. The dynamic array, also known as a resizable array or a growable array, is a data structure that allows for dynamic resizing, efficient insertion and deletion operations, and random access to elements.

**Features:**

**Dynamic Resizing:** The array automatically resizes itself when it runs out of capacity, ensuring efficient memory usage.

**Flexible Data Storage:** The array can store elements of any data type, providing versatility for various use cases.

**Array Operations:** Supports common array operations such as element insertion, deletion, and retrieval.

**Error Handling:** Includes error handling mechanisms for out-of-bounds access, ensuring program stability.

**Usage:**

To use the dynamic array in your C++ project, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository:**

git clone https://github.com/Justin7624/CSC136-Proj-3

**Be sure to include Array.h in Your Project:**

#include "Array.h"

**Create an Array Object... perform array operations, then compile and run!**

g++ Array.h main.cpp

./main
